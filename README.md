# My Full stack JS dev portfolio - 2021

Currently, and for about the last three years, I've been working as a Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree coordinator and Student Success Specialist for Treehouse, the online educational platform. That means I help design and create the software, programs, projects, and all supporting material for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree, our online version of a coding bootcamp. It also means I support students by reviewing their projects, helping them debug those projects, and mentoring them through the more challenging aspects of the learning process. In this role, I regularly use Slack, GitHub, Mode, JIRA, Confluence, AWS s3 and Zoom. It's been a blast and I've learned a ton. But as much as I've enjoyed mentoring students and developing curriculum, it's the problem solving and writing code that draws my true passion. As a consequence, my aspirations are to transition into a developer role.
